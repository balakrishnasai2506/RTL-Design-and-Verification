# HDL Scribbles

I code when I feel like it — and when I do, it usually ends up here.

These are bits and pieces of Verilog/SystemVerilog code — small modules, testbenches, and whatever I happen to be exploring at the time.

Feel free to look around, try things out, or just vibe with the waveforms. ;)
